# TODO List for ImportPhotos.pm

- Deal with PNG and PSD files. 

- Add a '-v' flag that shows the version you are running without actually running the script. 

- Add a check into the missing EXIF conflict number renamer so that if it hits 99, it croaks. That would almost certainly mean something went wrong. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Setup so that the Missing_EXIF_Date files are appended with a conflict number so they don't overwrite each other. 

- Switch over so that you aren't using memory for the files. This will prevent issues when copying over large movie files. 

- Check to make sure there is enough storage space for all output locations before running the script. 

- Test an images from every month. 

- Test across multiple years. 

- Setup a test that makes sure that the app fails if it can't write to all the defined output directories. 

- Test '.crw' files (or whatever the IR camera shoots)

- Test Images off of S90

- Test Images off of S90

- Test Images off of 5D

- Test Images off of 5DII

- Test Images off of Mark's 1D

- Test Images off of D30 IR

- Test Images off of old Fuji point and shoot F31

- Test Images off of old Fuji point and shoot F200

- Make sure that if you hit "99" in a filename that the process chokes. This almost certainly means there was a problem....

- Test Movies off 5D

- Test Movies off 5DII

- Test Movies off S90

- Test Movies off S100


## Someday/Maybe Items

- Setup so the script will log an error if it can't make a directory. 

- Setup test to explicitly check for croak if it can't make a directory. 

- Create a test that make sure that the file comparison will choke the script if the files aren't identical. Right now, this is tied into the code in a way that can't be easily tested. 

- Create a test to make sure that at least one input dir exists. 

- Add explicit test for what happens if you try to run a file that doesn't have a date/time stamp that you are looking for. The code is setup to croak, but that needs to be tested.
