This is a file that should only exist in the development environment. It 
keeps the ImportPhotos script from running if called directly. This is
done because the script would otherwise call the 
~/Library/ImportPhotos/ImportPhotos.ini file and run an actual process. 

With this file in place, the main script will see it and exist out.
